# Femex

This project is a hobby website that aims to reproduce a better version of [Phemex Exchange](https://phemex.com/trade/inverse/BTCUSD) trading terminal. Currently the orderbook and recent trades section is almost 80% completed.

## Roadmap

There are many ideas where this project can go from here but these are some of my thoughts for the project's roadmap:

- develop resizable panel feature for orderbook and recent trades seciton
- show cumulative quantites on orderbook
- create a trade creator panel
- define theme and light mode

## Maintainer Notes:

- add prettier attr sorter
- add tailwind class sorter
- add eslint
- add frist version number
